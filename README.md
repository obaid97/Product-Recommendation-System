# Product-Recommendation-System

The project involves creating a product recommendation system using the Amazon review dataset, which is compressed and has a size of 33 GB. The system will be built using Apache Spark for data processing and a Flask framework for the front end.

To start with, a Jupyter Notebook called "project.ipynb" will be used for data preprocessing. The dataset, consisting of 6 million rows, will be loaded into MongoDB using Apache Spark. Additionally, some exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed on the dataset. A model will be trained on a sample of the data.

There will be an "app.py" file containing a Python script for the Flask application. The implementation of Kafka will be included, which is a distributed streaming platform. The system will generate recommendations based on the trained model.

For the webpage, two files will be created: "home.html" and "get-recommendation.html". These files will provide the user interface for accessing the product recommendations.
